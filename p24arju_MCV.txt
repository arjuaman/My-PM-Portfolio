The motivation of this algorithm is to solve the problem of saving or wirelessly transmitting ECG data, which
tends to have a high sampling rate. By compressing the signal, more data can be stored or wirelessly
transferred using less power.
The wavelet transform has emerged over recent years as a powerful time-frequency analysis and signal coding
tool favored for the interrogation of complex non stationary signals.
With this project we achieved average compression ratio of 12.8 with acceptable signal preservation.

An Efficient Bar/QR Code Recognition System for Consumer Service Applications

Aug 20

Efficient bar code recognition system is crucial in a world where trade has evolved to quick commerce. We

2020

wanted to leverage image processing technology learned in our class to create a solution that could enhance
inventory control, and provide immediate, reliable information.
This paper proposes a method for combined bar code and QR code recognition.
The motivation is to have improved customer service in the consumer electronics industry. Need for accurate
information in production, storage, and supply chains drove this project.
It automatically decodes the code and displays complete product information.
it's developed in Python using OpenCV library (external libraries needed for decoding)
It was tested on a big database of items with assigned codes, with real-time image capture and processing.
It showed an accuracy of 100%
It has a very fast execution time of 0.25 seconds.
It has a future in prototyping on micro-controllers for a practical bar code recognition system.
This publication comes under the domain of "Image processing"

Detection of Malaria by Using a CNN Model

May 23

This publication was added to prestigious "Springer" on 31st May 2023.
This publication comes under the domain of "Deep Learning"
Malaria is a dangerous disease caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted by mosquito bites, with over 200
million people suffering worldwide and 200,000 deaths.
Diagnosis is traditionally done by microscopic blood smear analysis by trained technicians.
Traditional methods are time-consuming and prone to human error, which could be fatal to human life.
Our work proposes a fully automated algorithm using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify
malaria from blood smear images.
The dataset contains a total of 27,558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells.
The dataset contains all the images in a directory cell images. These images are categorized in 2 parts,
Parasitized and Uninfected. Both directories contain 13,780 images according to their category. We have taken
11,024 of each category to train our model (22048 training images) and 2,255 of each category for validation
(5510 validating images).
We split our data set into 80% training and 20% validation.
One of the major constraints during the implementation of the project was the geographical limitation of
images. The images are from Chittagong Medical College Hospital Bangladesh, which might have different
climatic conditions than any other place. Therefore there is a chance that findings are not geographically
independent.
Achieved 96.39% accuracy with 95% precision and 98% recall in detecting malaria parasites, with potential
for further improvement with larger datasets. The F1 score is 96%.
Our proposed model performs better than all the traditional Machine Learning algorithms like Ada Boost,
Decision Tree, KNN etc
