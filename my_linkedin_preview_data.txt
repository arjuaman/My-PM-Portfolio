About
I started my career as a Game Developer in an R&D role at Ingenuity Gaming
where I created colourful and feature-heavy experiences for clients. Then I
carried over this expertise to my next organization H&P, lending my hand in
making the lives of rig operators easy! I had a stint with Microsoft as a PM Intern,
got a PPO later, loved it!
I’ve finished 4/6 terms of my PGP curriculum at IIM Ahmedabad and am actively
involved in a variety of clubs and discussions

| Received PPO |
During my internship, I embarked on a deep dive into the everyday
challenges developers face with a proprietary process, immersing myself
in their experiences through extensive interviews and surveys. I
discovered critical pain points, hidden barriers that slowed their
productivity and impacted morale.
By carefully analyzing feedback, I uncovered significant gaps between
the available tools and what developers truly needed. Rather than
reinventing the wheel, I strategically identified ways to enhance and
integrate existing resources, streamlining workflows and reducing
cognitive overload.
Collaborating closely with multiple internal teams, I crafted clear, intuitive
solutions, complete with strategic mockups and user journeys, to
empower developers and simplify their day-to-day processes.
Finally, I translated these insights into actionable recommendations for
leadership, which will help drive impactful decisions focused on
developer efficiency and satisfaction.

I was working as a Frontend Developer at Helmerich & Payne (H&P), a
leading provider of drilling and completion services to the energy
industry. In my role as a Software Engineer 1, I focus on building and
maintaining the user-facing web applications that H&P employees and
partners rely on daily.
Contributed to a new internal project designed to improve the user
experience for drilling operations. This project involved building a user
interface (UI) that enables efficient well management from a single
location.
My role focused on the user experience (UX) for both internal and
external users. This includes designing interfaces that allow:
- Remote control capabilities: Operators can manage drilling operations
remotely.
- Multiple well management: The UI facilitates drilling of multiple wells
from a single interface.
By crafting intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, I helped to optimize well
management and empower both internal and external users.

PIMA Indian Onslaught of Diabetes

Show project

Tools used: Python, Flask, HTML
This project describes patient medical record data for Pima Indians and predicts
using a sequential model whether they had an onset of diabetes within five years.
The aim is to build a model robust enough such that if we feed in more data in the
future, it could prove beneficial to the medical world.

Last Words at Deathbed (Case study): Pagerank, Spidering, Scraping
and Visualizing
Dec 2019 - Mar 2020

Show project

I worked on the data from:
https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html
My aim was to get a list of all the last statements by those who were executed
and then make a WordCloud visualization of the most often words by them,
conditions being that length of words should be greater than 5. I started with
spidering the data from the site, used BeautifulSoup for the anchor tags,and then
again for the consequent paragraph tags, put them into a list and consequently
wrote into a file. I imported that file in a datagram, cleaned it and exported it to
csv, which helped me in converting to sqlite. Then I created a python file to get
the visualization.
